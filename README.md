# Pneumonia-X-ray-Classification-based-on-CNN

We try to present a pneumonia classification system which is based on modified VGG to assist radiologists in pneumonia diagnosis. 
The model was trained and tested based on an open source pneumonia x-ray dataset. 
The experiment results demonstrate that our fine-tuned VGG model can achieve a precise classification. 
The result proves the strong ability of modified VGG in classifying the small data collections.
