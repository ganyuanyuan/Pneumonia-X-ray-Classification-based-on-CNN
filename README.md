# Pneumonia-X-ray-Classification-based-on-CNN

We try to present a pneumonia classification system which is based on mod- ified VGG to assist radiologists in pneumonia diagno- sis. 
The model was trained and tested based on an open source pneumonia x-ray data-set. 
The experiment results demonstrate that our fine-tuned VGG model can achieve a precise classification. 
The result proves the strong abil- ity of modified VGG in classifying the small data collec- tions.
